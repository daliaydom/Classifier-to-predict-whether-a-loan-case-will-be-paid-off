# Classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off
## Final Assignment

In this project a classifier is build to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

The historical dataset from previous loan applications is cleaned and then, different calssification algorithm are applied, such as:
  * k-Nearest Neighbour
  * Decision Tree
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

  * Jaccard index
  * F1-score
  * LogLoass

### Libraries requiered:
  * Itertools
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Pandas
  * Sklearn
  * Seaborn

### Files requiered:
  * loan_train.csv
  * loan_test.csv
